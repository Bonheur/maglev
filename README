STEPS TO USE THIS AS A PLUGIN

1. Package this plugin using "grails package-plugin"
2. Create new Grails-app using 1.3.7 (lets say <SOME_PATH>/mySampleApp)
3. Copy the packaged plugin file to the lib directory of the sample app (cp <Plugin_svn_dir>/grails-grails-mgnl-0.1.zip <SOME_PATH>/mySampleApp/lib/grails-mgnl-0.1.zip )
4. Go to the sampleApp directory
5. Change the grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy to include the following lines :
		inherits("global") {
			excludes "xmlParserAPIs", "xml-apis", "commons-logging"
		}
	Instead of the following line:
		inherits("global") {
			// uncomment to disable ehcache
			// excludes 'ehcache'
		}
6. grails install plugin grails-mgnl 0.1 
7. grails run-app


We had to do so many steps as the plugin is not yet released on the repository. Infact if we place the zip of the plugin in the lib directory of the
plugin, it will be installed automatically on other systems as well if the application's application.properties has the following line:
	plugins.grails-mgnl=0.1
